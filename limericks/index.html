        <p>There once was a man from Peru,</p>
        <p>Who dreamed he was eating his shoe.</p>
        <p>He awoke with a fright,</p>
        <p>In the middle of the night,</p>
        <p>To find that his dream had come true.</p>

    <div>
        <h1 class="title">Another Limerick</h1>
        <p>There was an Old Man with a beard,</p>
        <p>Who said, "It is just as I feared!</p>
        <p>Two Owls and a Hen,</p>
        <p>Four Larks and a Wren,</p>
        <p>Have all built their nests in my beard."</p>
